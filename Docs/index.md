# OpenUI5 Template

By default, all apps run within the Power UI launchpad, which automatically provides navigation between apps, access to context buttons, offline data management, etc. This launchpad is different from the SAP Fiori launchpad - there is no interaction between the launchpads. However, generated UI5 apps can be exported and deployed on NetWeaver or even the Fiori launchpad as described in the [export documentation](exporting_fiori_apps/index.md).
