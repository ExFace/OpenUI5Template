## Auto-generated launchpads with `NavTiles`
<a name="navtiles"></a>

You can quickly generate a launchpad with a tile for every page in a folder (even across multiple levels) like this with a `NavTiles` widget. See the widget documentation at Administration > Documentations > Widgets.

Note: in contrast to typical UI5 tiles, `NavTiles` will have titles and subtitles, but no icons. That's because all tiles have the same action `exface.Core.GoToPage` and, thus, would also get the same icon - this would not look very nice. To get a launchpad with icons and custom actions, you will need to create it manually - see below.
