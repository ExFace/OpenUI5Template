# Installing an UI5 progressive web app

Every page produced by the UI5 facade can be installed as a Progressive Web App (PWA) on a mobile device - as long, as the mobile browser supports PWAs:

1. Open the URL of the start page of the future app in the browser of your mobile device
2. Add the page to the home screen
	- On **Android** Chrome
		1. Open the mennu (three dots in the upper right corner)
		2. Select "Add to Homescreen"
		3. Enter a name for the shortcut and press OK
	- On **iOS** Safari
		1. Tap the Share button on the browser's toolbar. This is the rectangle with an arrow pointing upward; it's on the bar at the top of the screen on an iPad, and on the bar at the bottom of the screen on an iPhone or iPod Touch.
		2. Tap the "Add to Home Screen" icon in the Share menu.
3. Tap on the newly created shortcut to launch the app. It will install automatically now.

Now you can launch the app from the home screen directly. It will also start offline and will even show previously viewed data.
